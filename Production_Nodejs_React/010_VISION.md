## 1. Purpose

The **Channel Manager** is a private configuration and observability surface for a
multi-agent system whose primary runtime is **OpenClaw** (the Harness).

It is built to give the operator a single place where three things come together:

1. **Configure channels** — which Telegram Topic Group (TTG) is bound to **one
   main agent**, with a **model** choice for that agent’s run on this channel,
   **sub-agents** attached to the channel, and **skills** layered as **agent /
   sub-agent defaults plus extra skills per channel** (the same TTG can give TARS
   a different skill set than another TTG). MCP allowlisting narrows tools. The
   operator’s **source of truth** for this picture is **`channel_config.json`**;
   governed slices are **pushed into OpenClaw** only via explicit **Apply**
   (preview, confirm, audit) — see §2.2, **Bundle C1** (shipped) and **C1b**
   (roadmap §5.1).
2. **Observe channels** — mirror the session-native OpenClaw transcript of the
   selected TTG so the operator can read the actual agent conversation without
   Telegram being the only window.
3. **Bridge work back into memory** — surface IDE/Cursor project summaries and,
   on explicit request, promote them into OpenClaw's long-term memory.

Everything else is either a means to these three ends or explicitly out of scope.

The repo also ships a **Workbench**, but its product role is deliberately
narrower than "IDE": it is a **lean local editing and diff surface for artifacts
and source files**. It supports human and agentic edit/review workflows around
files, but it is not a Cursor/VS Code replacement and does not own channel,
TTG, memory, or sync decisions. See
[`SPEC_WORKBENCH_POSITIONING.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_WORKBENCH_POSITIONING.md).

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Gateway-first

**OpenClaw is the source of truth for agent traffic.**
The Channel Manager does not run its own Telegram `getUpdates` poller and does
not maintain a parallel chat model. Inbound data is read from the canonical
OpenClaw session JSONL; outbound data is delivered through the OpenClaw send
surface, with the CLI fallback as the default and the native gateway path gated
behind `OPENCLAW_CM_SEND_TRANSPORT`. A 2026-04-24 beta smoke verified the
native `session-native-gateway-chat` path on a warm gateway; CLI remains the
safe default until the OpenClaw gateway import/SDK surface is stable. This
principle exists to avoid the 409
`getUpdates` conflicts and the "two-truth" drift we encountered in earlier
iterations.

### 2.2 Configure-and-project, never overwrite silently

The Channel Manager owns **`channel_config.json`**. It **projects** that state
to the OpenClaw Gateway (`openclaw.json`) and to IDE hosts (`.cursor/*`) only
through explicit export endpoints and, for write operations, through an
**Apply** action with diff preview. There is no background writer into
`~/.openclaw` or `~/.cursor`.

**Today (Bundle C1):** Apply merges **`requireMention`** into
`channels.telegram.groups` in `openclaw.json`. **Bundle C1b** extends the merge
to additional fields the OpenClaw schema allows (e.g. **model** under
**`agents.*`**, **skills** on groups and/or agent allowlists), using a **versioned
mapping table** — never ad hoc keys that the gateway rejects. Background:
[`030_ROADMAP.md`](./030_ROADMAP.md) §5.1 and
[`_archive/2026-04/CHANNEL_MANAGER_TelegramSync_RESEARCH.md`](./_archive/2026-04/CHANNEL_MANAGER_TelegramSync_RESEARCH.md) §2.4–2.5.

### 2.3 Separation of config, runtime, and memory

Three domains with three different file owners:

| Domain  | Owner                 | Examples                                         |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Config  | Channel Manager       | `channel_config.json`, UI state                  |
| Runtime | OpenClaw (Harness)    | session JSONL, `sessions.json`, `openclaw.json`  |
| Memory  | OpenClaw workspace    | `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/`, `MEMORY.md`     |

Cross-domain writes are always explicit, previewed and auditable.

### 2.4 One main agent per channel; model is not a second “engine switch”

A channel is bound to **one main agent** (typically **TARS** in the default
triad). The operator may choose a **different LLM per channel** for that main
agent’s runs; that is a **model** binding, not a second main-agent picker (see
`040_DECISIONS.md` §ADR-007 — no triad **engine** dropdown on the channel).
Sub-agents provide specialization; **skills** stack as defaults plus per-channel
additions. **Channel Manager “sub-agents”** are configuration roles; **OpenClaw
runtime sub-agents** (spawn sessions) and **external orchestration** (e.g.
Paperclip) are different concepts — see `040_DECISIONS.md` §ADR-004 and the
research note linked in §2.2.

### 2.5 Stable keys, ephemeral sessions

- **Stable:** Telegram `group_id`, session-key `agent:main:telegram:group:<id>`.
- **Ephemeral:** OpenClaw `sessionId` (UUID), `sessionFile` path.

The Channel Manager persists the stable identifiers only and resolves the
ephemeral ones at runtime.

## 3. The Harness triad

The operational context is the Harness persona triad — **TARS · MARVIN · CASE**
— described in `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md` and `SOUL.md`. The Channel
Manager assumes the triad exists; it does not redefine it.

`SONIC` is a historical name; the mapping is **SONIC → CASE**.

---

## 4. Relationship to Studio Framework

The **Studio Framework** is the operator's outer knowledge base and artifact
repository (ARYS/GILD schema, A070_ide_cursor_summaries, skill definitions). The
Channel Manager:

- **Reads** Markdown in **A070_ide_cursor_summaries** to display it in the Cursor Summary tab.
- **Does not own** the pipeline that produces those summaries.
- **Does not write** into `Studio_Framework/` directly.

The canonical Studio root is resolved via `STUDIO_FRAMEWORK_ROOT` (defaulting
to `WORKSPACE_ROOT/Studio_Framework`).

Open Brain integration keeps this boundary: Studio Framework artifacts remain
the durable source of truth; OpenClaw memory is operational agent continuity;
Open Brain is the long-term semantic/MCP knowledge layer. Producer surfaces
(Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Telegram, Chat) may create or update artifacts, but
they do not become separate memory authorities.

**Open Brain (OB1) — preparatory stance.** The Channel Manager side ships
**contracts and audit hooks** (export payload, optional stub sync record) so a
**live** OB1/MCP upsert can land later without redesigning the bridge. We do
**not** need to finish OB1 in this repo while the **canonical corpus** is still
incomplete: substantive knowledge and legacy artifacts still live **outside**
Studio Framework (other repos, drafts, imports) and must be **curated into**
`Studio_Framework/` (e.g. under `050_Artifacts/`, per ARYS/traceability rules)
before semantic sync is meaningful.

**Onboarding gate for every imported artifact.** Any artifact that is **bulk
loaded, migrated, or ingested** into Studio Framework is expected to pass an
explicit **onboarding pass**: YAML front matter and document structure are
**reviewed or normalized** (stable `id`, `type`, TTG/project binding fields,
tags, traceability, body conventions) so the artifact index, secret gate, and
Open Brain export contract all see a **consistent, reviewable shape**. The IDE
memory bridge consumes that normalized layer; it does **not** replace a
Studio-side ingestion and normalization process (scheduled in
[`030_ROADMAP.md`](./030_ROADMAP.md) §8b.6; playbook
[`README_ARTIFACT_INGESTION_AND_ONBOARDING.md`](../../Studio_Framework/050_Artifacts/README_ARTIFACT_INGESTION_AND_ONBOARDING.md)).

The Workbench fits this relationship as a local artifact/worktree editor: it
can inspect and edit files in allowed roots and make diffs visible, but it does
not become a second source of truth for TTG binding, memory promotion, or Open
Brain synchronization.

## 5. Non-goals (MVP)

The following are intentionally **not** in scope for the current cycle:

- Running a second Telegram client or a parallel chat surface.
- Writing into OpenClaw's `openclaw.json` without explicit user confirmation.
- Writing into `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` automatically from summaries.
- Media (images, files) on the send path — text only until the gateway
  supports media natively (`030_ROADMAP.md` backlog).
- Engine-per-message selection (a channel stays bound to one main agent).
- Replacing full IDEs such as Cursor or VS Code. The Workbench is intentionally
  a lean local artifact/worktree edit and diff surface.
- Multi-user tenancy, authentication, or remote operator UIs.

## 6. Success criteria for the current cycle

A run is "successful" if the operator can, on a fresh machine:

1. Start the stack with one documented command.
2. Configure a TTG, assign one main agent, model choice, one sub-agent, layered
   skills, and MCP scope — and see the mirrored `channel_config.json` on disk.
3. Send a message from the Channel Manager UI and see the agent reply within
   the same panel within ~3s of the reply landing in the session JSONL.
4. Use **Apply to OpenClaw** to merge governed fields from Channel Manager into
   `openclaw.json` with preview, explicit confirm, backup, and undo (**C1**
   shipped for `requireMention`; **C1b** broadens the merge — `030_ROADMAP.md`
   §5.1).
5. Promote a summary from A070_ide_cursor_summaries into OpenClaw memory (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or
   `MEMORY.md` with extra acknowledgement) after preview and confirm, with an
   audit entry (**Bundle C2** — shipped; `030_ROADMAP.md` §6).
6. Never lose data to a silent write or a racing file poller.

If any of these breaks, we have a product regression, not a polish task.
