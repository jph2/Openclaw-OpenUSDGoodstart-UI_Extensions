## 1. Snapshot (2026-04-18)

| Area                                | State                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Configuration tab                   | Functional; TTG CRUD, sub-agent CRUD, skills list, row heights persist                            |
| OpenClaw Chat mirror                | Functional; auto-scroll v3 live, tool chips collapsible, CLI send + JSONL mirror; **2026-04-20 UX:** optimistic user bubble, 200 ms session tail poll, bubble timestamps with seconds (until §8c native gateway path) |
| Cursor Summary tab                  | Read-only MVP live; A070 list + renderer                                                         |
| IDE Bridge (MCP)                    | Live for `send_telegram_reply` and `change_agent_mode`                                           |
| Exports (read-only projections)    | Live: `/api/exports/{canonical,openclaw,ide,cursor}`                                             |
| Config Apply to `openclaw.json`     | **C1 + C1b.1 + C1b.2a + C1b.2b + C1b.2c + C1b.2e + C1b.3:** per-channel groups + synth `agents.list[]` / `bindings[]` (skills include **C1b.3**) + orphan prune; optional **`channels.telegram` account policy**; optional **`agents.defaults.model.primary`** when `openclawAgentsDefaultsPolicy.applyModelOnOpenClawApply`. **Stale Telegram sessions** — `scripts/cm-release-telegram-session` (**C1b.2d**). |
| Summary promotion to memory/        | **Live (C2):** `POST /api/summaries/promote` + IDE tab modal (daily `memory/*.md` or `MEMORY.md`) |
| `occ-ctl.mjs`                       | Not in tree; `npm start` / `npm run dev` are the current entrypoints                              |
| **Bundle A (performance + cleanup)**| **Closed 2026-04-18** — P1 fan-kill, P2 latency, P2b scroll v3, P3 dead code, P4 tool accordion, CLI Node-24 fix |
| **Bundle B (refactor)**             | **Closed 2026-04-18** — P5 chat service split, P4 `/api/chat/*` + legacy route aliases                          |
| **Local LLM (LM Studio)**           | Wired 2026-04-18: `models.providers.lmstudio` + enabled `plugins.entries.lmstudio` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`; channels and `agents.list[]` use `lmstudio/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b`. Bootstrap trimmed (`bootstrapMaxChars: 4000`, `bootstrapTotalMaxChars: 14000`, `experimental.localModelLean: true`). **Open dependency:** the LM Studio app must load the model with `n_ctx ≥ 16384` (32768 recommended) — not auto-configurable from this repo. |
| **OpenClaw webchat ↔ binding parity** | **Known limitation (not in CM scope):** the OpenClaw webchat opens session `agent:main:telegram:group:<id>` and therefore shows `agents.defaults.model`, while inbound Telegram traffic routes through CM's `bindings[]` and uses the per-channel model. Fix lives in OpenClaw upstream (resolve the synth agent for the Telegram peer in the webchat session resolver). See `040_DECISIONS.md` ADR-018. |

## 2. Phase 0 — Documentation consolidation (done today)

**Outcome:** 14 patched/dated documents distilled into 4 normative docs:

- `010_VISION.md` — purpose, principles, non-goals
- `020_ARCHITECTURE.md` — the current system
- `030_ROADMAP.md` — this file
- `040_DECISIONS.md` — ADR log

Source documents moved to `_archive/2026-04/` with a breadcrumb pointer
(`_archive/2026-04/README.md`). The archive is **reference-only**; new
information lands in the four normative docs.

---

## 3. Bundle A — Performance and cleanup (done)

**Goal:** unbreak CPU and perceived latency, remove dead code and stale
fallbacks. No architectural changes. Landed as three commits in order P1 → P2 → P3.

### A / P1 — Fan kill (done)

- ✅ Replaced the 2-second sessions-directory polling in `telegramService.js`
  with two scoped `chokidar.watch()` instances: one on `sessions.json`
  (debounced 200 ms), one whose path set tracks the canonical `sessionFile`
  of each group currently present in `sessions.json`.
- ✅ Removed the internal rate-limit trampoline inside
  `hydrateOpenclawSessionIndex` and the per-call hydrate inside
  `resolveCanonicalSession` / `refreshChatMirrorFromCanonicalSession`.

### A / P2 — Perceived latency (done)

- ✅ `TelegramChat.jsx` switched to `behavior: 'auto'`, keyed the auto-scroll
  effect on `filteredMessages.length`, and added a `stuckToBottomRef` gate so
  auto-scroll only runs when the user is within 80 px of the bottom.
- ✅ SSE state updates (`INIT`, `SESSION_REBOUND`, `MESSAGE`) are wrapped in
  `startTransition()` so typing, button clicks and scroll stay responsive
  during bursts.

### A / P2b — Scroll-settle follow-up (done, third iteration)

Field tests of P2 and the first two P2b revisions both failed. Documenting
the dead ends so we don't reinvent them:

1. **v1 (sentinel + rAF).** `sentinel.scrollIntoView({block:'end'})` inside
   a single `requestAnimationFrame`. Missed late markdown / code-block
   layout (`scrollHeight` grew after the rAF fired).
2. **v2 (sentinel + rAF cascade + `ResizeObserver` on scroll container).**
   Added a 60 ms + 180 ms cascade and a `ResizeObserver` observing
   `containerRef`. The observer never actually fired: the scroll
   container is `flex: 1`, its border-box never resizes when content is
   added; only its `scrollHeight` does.
3. **v3 (final, MutationObserver + `scrollTop = scrollHeight`).** Rip
   out the sentinel, the rAF, the cascade, and the suppress-window
   boolean. Wrap the message list in a `messagesInnerRef` and observe
   it with a `MutationObserver` (`childList`, `subtree`, `characterData`).
   Any DOM change — new bubble, ReactMarkdown finishing, tool-output
   `<pre>` expanding, chevron-chip toggling — fires the observer and
   we set `scrollTop = scrollHeight` directly if the user is still
   pinned. The pin threshold is 80 px from the bottom. Our own
   programmatic scroll lands at `scrollHeight` exactly, so the
   resulting scroll event keeps `distanceFromBottom = 0` and the pin
   stays on without needing a suppress window.

The v3 implementation has four moving parts total (`messagesInnerRef`,
`stuckToBottomRef`, `handleContainerScroll`, one `MutationObserver`)
down from eight in v2, and makes no assumption about when markdown or
code blocks finish laying out.

### A / P3 — Dead code purge (done)

- ✅ Deleted `historyScanner.mjs`, `ActiveBotsList.jsx` and the
  `/api/telegram/bots/:chatId` route + `getChatBots`.
- ✅ Removed the `Telegraf` import, the `bot` / `relayBot` / `mainBotInfo` /
  `relayBotInfo` globals, the `scanHistory` hydration block, and the
  disabled `bot.launch()` scaffolding from `telegramService.js`.
- ✅ Removed the hardcoded `-3736210177 → -1003752539559` alias fix-up from
  both `CHAT_ID_ALIASES` and `routes/telegram.js`.
- ✅ Removed the `process.cwd()`-relative Prototyp fallback in
  `hydrateChannelAliasesFromDiskSync`; the function now requires
  `WORKSPACE_ROOT` and logs a single warning if it is missing.
- ✅ Removed `sendViaHttpGateway` and its call site in `sendMessageToChat`.
  The HTTP fast path was never reachable in practice; `sendMessageToChat`
  now goes straight to the `openclaw` CLI. It will be re-introduced only
  when the gateway exposes a functional
  `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/send`.

**Acceptance (observed):**

- CPU on an idle chat panel is effectively zero; fan no longer ramps.
- First paint of an open chat is well under 300 ms on a warm backend.
- `grep` for `historyScanner`, `Telegraf`, `sendViaHttpGateway`,
  `getChatBots`, `ActiveBotsList`, or the hardcoded group-id fallback
  returns no hits outside `_archive/` and standalone `backend/test-*.js`
  scripts.

### A / P4 — Tool call / tool result accordion (done)

Feedback on the live chat: `⚙️ [Tool Call: exec]` markers and raw
`System (Tool) BOT` output bubbles made the transcript hard to scan.
OpenClaw's own UI keeps those collapsed by default and reveals the
payload on click.

- ✅ Backend: `buildMsgObjFromGatewayLine` no longer flattens toolCall /
  toolResult into text markers. Instead it attaches two structured
  arrays to the message: `toolCalls: [{id, name, input}]` and
  `toolResults: [{id, toolUseId, toolName, output, isError}]`. The
  `output` field flattens nested `content` blocks (string or
  `[{type:"text", text}]`).
- ✅ Frontend: new `ToolCallChip` renders under an assistant bubble
  ("⚙ exec" chevron chip; click expands the JSON `input`). New
  `ToolResultBubble` replaces the entire `senderRole === 'toolResult'`
  bubble with a single-line preview ("Tool output · exec · <first 72
  chars>") that expands into a scrollable `<pre>` on click. Error
  results use a red accent.
- ✅ `stripToolCallMarkers` removes the residual
  `⚙️ [Tool Call: …]` / `✅ [Tool Result: …]` text so we don't render the
  same information twice during the transition period.
- ✅ `filteredMessages` keeps bubbles that have no plain text but do
  carry structured tool data, so a pure tool-call or tool-result
  message is never silently dropped.

---

## 4. Bundle B — Refactor (after A)

**Goal:** split the god objects so Bundle C can be built on clean seams.
Keep external API stable; mount aliases for one release.

**In plain terms:** Bundle B is “housekeeping”: it does not add operator-facing
features, but it cuts the chat stack into testable pieces and one coherent HTTP
surface so C1/C2 (writes into `openclaw.json` and memory) do not land on a
monolith. When B is done, you should see the same UI behavior with clearer file
boundaries and documented `/api/chat/*` routes.

### B / P5 — Service split

Split `telegramService.js` into focused modules under `backend/services/chat/`:

- `sessionIndex.js` — `sessions.json` watcher + group/session mapping.
- `sessionTail.js` — chokidar tail of one canonical JSONL.
- `messageModel.js` — `buildMsgObjFromGatewayLine` and UI-shape helpers.
- `sessionSender.js` — `openclaw` CLI wrapper (and, later, native session send).
- `channelAliases.js` — channel alias resolution from `channel_config.json`.

Frontend: extract `useChatSession(groupId)` hook; rename `TelegramChat.jsx`
to `ChatPanel.jsx` (render-only).

- ✅ **Done 2026-04-18** — modules under `backend/services/chat/`, facade
  `telegramService.js`, `useChatSession` + `ChatPanel.jsx`.

### B / P4 — Route consolidation

Merge `routes/telegram.js` and `routes/openclaw.js` into `routes/chat.js`
exposing `/api/chat/:groupId/{session,stream,send}`. Delete the dynamic
`await import` workaround in `routes/openclaw.js`. Keep `/api/telegram/*`
and `/api/openclaw/session/*/send` mounted as thin aliases for **one**
release, then remove.

- ✅ **Done 2026-04-18** — canonical `routes/chat.js` + thin alias routers;
  frontend uses `/api/chat/*`; MCP still uses legacy `POST /api/telegram/send`.

**Acceptance:**

- No single service file > ~250 lines.
- No dynamic imports in route files.
- Old paths still respond; new paths documented in `020_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 5. Bundle C1 — Config apply (after B)

**Goal:** let the operator promote `channel_config.json` state into the
OpenClaw Gateway's `openclaw.json`, safely.

### Backend

- ✅ `POST /api/exports/openclaw/apply` — landed 2026-04-18.
  - `dryRun: true` default; `dryRun: false` + `confirm: true` required to write.
  - Zod validation of merged document (`channels.telegram.groups` sanity + passthrough).
  - File lock (`proper-lockfile`) on `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` or `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
  - Timestamped backup (`openclaw.json.<iso>.bak`), rotate after **10**.
  - Atomic write (temp + `rename`).
  - Append-only audit: `channel-manager-openclaw-apply-audit.jsonl` beside `openclaw.json`.
  - **Merge scope:** for each channel in `channel_config.json`, upsert
    `channels.telegram.groups[<id>].requireMention` from `require_mention` and
    `channels.telegram.groups[<id>].skills` from `skills` (**C1b.1**, deduped ids); do not
    remove gateway-only groups; do not touch `botToken` / `gateway` / other keys.
- ✅ `POST /api/exports/openclaw/undo` with `{ confirm: true }` — restores newest `.bak`.
- ✅ `GET /api/exports/openclaw/apply-status` — `canUndo`, backup count, destination path.

### Frontend

- ✅ Header action **Apply to OpenClaw…** (Manage Channels) opens `OpenClawApplyModal`.
- ✅ Redacted side-by-side diff, destination path, **Confirm apply**, **Undo last apply**, refresh.

**Acceptance:**

- No apply can happen without explicit Confirm in the dialog.
- Backups accumulate to a bounded number (rotate after N).
- Schema failure blocks write.

**Follow-ups:**

- **Bundle C1b (§5.1)** — **closed 2026-04-20** (model + synth agents + bindings + account policy + workspace default model + sub-agent skills + orphan prune; see §5.1).
- Optional separate JSON Schema file for stricter validation.
- **C1b.2d (productize)** — surface stale `sessions.json` pins in Apply preview and offer release (today: [`scripts/cm-release-telegram-session`](./scripts/cm-release-telegram-session)).

---

## 5.1. Bundle C1b — Master config → OpenClaw (extended Apply)

**Status:** **closed (2026-04-20)** · **Depends on:** C1 (apply pipeline, audit, undo) · **Blocks:** nothing in the A → B chain.

**Suggested next (same product area, not a new bundle letter):** **C1b.2d productization** — in **Apply to OpenClaw** preview, detect `agent:main:telegram:group:<id>` (and related) pins in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json` for peers whose binding/model changes on this Apply; offer **Release session** (reuse logic from [`scripts/cm-release-telegram-session`](./scripts/cm-release-telegram-session)) with explicit confirm. Until then the script remains the operator path.

**Shipped (C1b.1 — 2026-04-18):** `channels.telegram.groups[id].skills` is merged from `channel_config.json` `channels[].skills` (deduped string ids) together with `requireMention`, via the same Apply / undo / audit path. Empty CM list → empty `skills` array on the group in `openclaw.json`.

**Shipped (C1b.2a — 2026-04-18):** Per-channel **model** + main-agent **skills allowlist** now ride the same Apply pipeline, written as synthesized `agents.list[]` entries (id `<assignedAgent>-<groupIdSlug>`, e.g. `tars-5168034995`) plus matching `bindings[] { type: 'route', match: { channel: 'telegram', peer: { kind: 'group', id } } }`. Every CM-emitted entry carries `comment: "managed-by: channel-manager; source: <groupId>"`. Operator-authored entries are detected by the absence of that marker and are **never** modified. Synth-id and telegram-peer collisions against operator-owned rows are surfaced to the UI; a write with any collision is refused (HTTP 409). See spec: [`_archive/2026-04/CHANNEL_MANAGER_C1b.2_MODEL_MAPPING_SPEC.md`](./_archive/2026-04/CHANNEL_MANAGER_C1b.2_MODEL_MAPPING_SPEC.md) (sign-off: §9).

**Shipped (C1b.2b — 2026-04-20):** **Orphan prune** on every Apply (after the C1b.2a upsert): CM-marked `agents.list[]` / `bindings[]` whose managed `source` group id is **not** present in `channel_config.json` `channels[].id` are removed. Preview + audit log surface `orphanPruneSummary` (counts + id list). Operator-owned rows untouched.

**Shipped (C1b.2d — stale-session release, 2026-04-20):** when an Apply changes the binding for a Telegram peer that already has a session entry pinned to a provider-specific `authProfileOverride` in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json`, that pinned session short-circuits the new binding and the model change has no visible effect. Interim tool: [`scripts/cm-release-telegram-session`](./scripts/cm-release-telegram-session) (`--list`, `--dry-run`, `--restart`) — backs up `sessions.json`, removes the stale `agent:main:telegram:group:<id>` entry, optionally restarts the gateway; next inbound message then binds through the CM-written `bindings[]` → synth agent → CM model. Productize as part of Apply (detect + offer release in the preview modal) once the manual tool has proven itself in practice. Tracks ADR-018 on the upstream side. **Also shipped 2026-04-20:** CM live-mirror follow-ups (agent-id-agnostic session index, polling JSONL tailer, transport-prefix-aware chat-id normalization; see [DISCOVERY §11](./_archive/2026-04/CHANNEL_MANAGER_TelegramSync_DISCOVERY.md#11-runtime-lessons--channel-manager-live-mirror-2026-04-20)). TTG000 acceptance test passed: Telegram → OC Web + CM panel synchronized in real time without page reload.

**Shipped (C1b.2e — 2026-04-20):** **Telegram account policy** in CM: Manage Channels panel + `channel_config.json` → `telegramAccountPolicy` (`applyOnOpenClawApply`, `groupPolicy`, `dmPolicy`, `allowFrom`, `groupAllowFrom`). **Apply** merges into `openclaw.json` `channels.telegram` only when `applyOnOpenClawApply` is true (explicit opt-in, same posture as C1b.2c). Preview lists the JSON patch; `GET /api/channels` adds `openclawTelegramAccountLive` for comparison with the live gateway file. `POST /api/channels/updateTelegramAccountPolicy` persists the slice. *Context:* account-level gates run *above* per-group bindings and can drop traffic silently (e.g. `groupPolicy: allowlist` + empty `groupAllowFrom` — TTG001/TTG000 regression, 2026-04-20).

**Shipped (C1b.3 — 2026-04-20):** **Sub-agent skill flavoring** — CM synth `agents.list[].skills` unions active `subAgents` (`parent` = channel `assignedAgent`, `enabled !== false`, not in `inactiveSubAgents`) `additionalSkills` minus each sub’s `inactiveSkills`, deduped (same layering as the TTG UI; ADR-004 unchanged).

**Shipped (C1b.2c — 2026-04-20):** **Workspace default model (opt-in)** — `channel_config.json` → `openclawAgentsDefaultsPolicy` (`applyModelOnOpenClawApply`, `modelPrimary`). **Apply** sets `agents.defaults.model.primary` only when the opt-in is true and `modelPrimary` is non-empty; existing `model` object fields (e.g. `fallbacks`) are preserved. Manage Channels panel + `POST /api/channels/updateOpenclawAgentsDefaultsPolicy`; `GET /api/channels` adds `openclawAgentsDefaultsLive.modelPrimary`. Complements ADR-018 (never silent).

**Recommended execution order (operator + implementer, 2026-04-20):** (1) Acceptance matrix in [`000_WIP TEST_20.04.26.md`](./000_WIP%20TEST_20.04.26.md) as needed. (2) **C1b.2b** — shipped. (3) **C1b.2e** — shipped. (4) **C1b.3** — shipped. (5) **C1b.2c** — shipped. **C1b.2d** + CM mirror hardening shipped; remaining CLI-send latency is tracked in **§8b.1** and the proper CM-side remedy is **§8b.4** gateway-native transport.

**Goal:** align operator expectations with reality: **Channel Manager** is the single place to define per-channel **agent model**, **sub-agent / skill policy**, and related knobs that OpenClaw’s gateway actually honors, then **push** them through the same explicit **Apply** path (preview, confirm, backup, audit) already used for `requireMention`.

**Background (for implementers):** OpenClaw-native semantics for **multi-agent routing**, **spawn sub-agents** (policy / session keys), **skills** allowlists, and the boundary vs **Paperclip** (external orchestration) are summarized with doc links in [`_archive/2026-04/CHANNEL_MANAGER_TelegramSync_RESEARCH.md`](./_archive/2026-04/CHANNEL_MANAGER_TelegramSync_RESEARCH.md) §2.4–2.5 — use when building the C1b mapping table and ADR-004 wording.

**Why a separate bundle:** C1 deliberately merged only `requireMention` after schema regressions (e.g. forbidden keys crashing the engine). C1b requires a **documented mapping** from `channel_config.json` fields to **`openclaw.json` (and any gateway fields)** per OpenClaw version, plus clarity on **ADR-004** (CM sub-agents vs runtime sub-agents vs workspace skills — what gets written vs what stays UI-only).

**Scope (draft — refine before implementation):**

1. **Inventory** — list which Channel Manager Configuration fields must become OpenClaw truth (model id, tools/MCP allowlists, group overrides vs `agents.defaults`, etc.).
2. **Contract** — confirm with OpenClaw schema or team which paths are legal; add validation so Apply **never** emits invalid JSON.
3. **Merge implementation** — extend `openclawApply.js` (or successor) with field-level merge rules; preserve gateway-only keys; same lock/backup/audit semantics as C1.
4. **UI** — extend **Apply to OpenClaw** preview so operators see **all** fields in the merge slice (not only `requireMention`); optional toggles per category if rollout is phased.
5. **Docs** — update `010_VISION.md` / `020_ARCHITECTURE.md` and add or amend **ADR** when the mapping is locked.

**Acceptance (high level):**

- After Apply + gateway reload (or documented procedure), **OpenClaw chat shows the model (and other pushed settings)** that Channel Manager shows for that channel, modulo documented exceptions.
- No silent writes; failed Zod/schema validation never truncates `openclaw.json`.
- ADR-004 consequences remain explicit in UI labels and in the merge spec (“written to OpenClaw” vs “Channel Manager only”).

**Out of scope for C1b unless re-scoped:** changing OpenClaw runtime to spawn CM “sub-agents” as native sub-agents; triad sliders; engine-per-message picker (see §8).

---

## 6. Bundle C2 — Summary → memory promotion (after C1)

**Goal:** let the operator explicitly carry an IDE/Cursor summary into
OpenClaw's memory space.

**Status:** shipped 2026-04-18.

### Backend

- ✅ `POST /api/summaries/promote` (also `/api/ide-project-summaries/promote`) —
  reads source under **Studio A070**, appends into:
  - `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (daily), or
  - `~/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md` (workspace root; extra `memoryMdAck`).
  - Append semantics, not replace.
  - De-duplication via stable `<!-- CM_PROMOTE_<sha256> -->` marker (skip if present).
  - Audit: `channel-manager-memory-promote-audit.jsonl` under the OpenClaw workspace.
  - `dryRun: true` (default) for preview; `dryRun: false` + `confirm: true` to write.
  - File lock (`proper-lockfile`) on the destination markdown.

### Frontend

- ✅ **Promote to OpenClaw memory…** on the **TARS in IDE** tab when an A070 file
  is selected (`MemoryPromoteModal.jsx`).
- Modal: destination (daily date picker vs `MEMORY.md`), **Check destination** dry
  run, append preview, duplicate warning, **Confirm promote**.

**Default mode:** manual-with-preview (see `040_DECISIONS.md` §ADR-014).

**Acceptance:**

- Nothing lands in memory without an explicit click and confirm.
- `MEMORY.md` requires checkbox acknowledgement before confirm.

## 8. Future (out of scope for this cycle)

- **Triad weighting in the channel UI** (three sliders summing to 100 %);
  depends on Harness/OpenClaw semantics and schema work.
- **Main-agent dynamic spawn flag** (a main agent allowed to spawn additional
  sub-agents at runtime); depends on OpenClaw runtime contract.
- **Multi-user or remote operator UIs.**
- **Engine-per-message picker** — explicitly rejected in `040_DECISIONS.md`
  §ADR-007; do not re-raise without a new decision record.

---

## 8b. Out-of-scope follow-ups (known, not blocking Bundle A)

These items surfaced while closing Bundle A but live outside the
Channel Manager's own codebase, so they don't block Bundle B.

### 8b.1 · CLI gateway auth → agent cold-start latency

**Symptom:** CM sends still feel slower than OpenClaw Control UI because
each message goes through a short-lived `openclaw agent ...` CLI process,
then the UI observes the result through the JSONL mirror. Older field runs
showed **~12 s** until user echo and **~25–30 s** until final answer when
the CLI missed gateway auth and fell back to embedded startup.

**Correct auth contract (cleanup correction 2026-04-24):** do **not** add
`tools.gatewayToken` to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. That is not a valid
`openclaw.json` key in the installed CLI build; the schema validator rejects
it with `Unrecognized key "gatewayToken"`. The CLI error hint about
`gatewayToken in tools` refers to the plugin-SDK call options bag, not the
`tools` block of `openclaw.json`.

**Channel Manager state:** `sessionSender.js` injects gateway credentials into
the CLI child process via env:

- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`

Values come from the process env first, otherwise from
`gateway.auth.token` + `gateway.port` in `openclaw.json`
(`OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` override supported). This is the supported warm-gateway
path for the current CLI behavior.

**Verified 2026-04-20 (18:50 CEST):** `/tmp/openclaw-cm-send-ad454416-*.log`
no longer showed `Gateway agent failed; falling back to embedded`. The CLI
reached the warm gateway. `runner: "embedded"` in `executionTrace` is the
gateway-side runner type (`runner?: "embedded" | "cli"`), not proof of a
CLI-level fallback. Measured model inference for one Kimi-K2.5 send was
`meta.durationMs = 2870` ms.

**Residual latency:** remaining CM-visible delay comes from CLI process
startup, gateway-side bootstrap work, and JSONL-tail observation
(`sessionTail` now polls at 200 ms). Proper remedy is §8b.4:
gateway-native CM transport. CLI auth/Node checks remain relevant only for
the fallback path. If the fallback is used, ensure Node for the CLI spawn is
>= v22 (`OPENCLAW_NODE_BIN` or runtime resolver), then verify logs before
changing config.

### 8b.2a · OpenClaw webchat reads `agents.defaults.model`, not the Telegram binding

**Symptom:** after Apply, Telegram traffic in the affected group is answered
by the model you set in CM (Gemma via LM Studio, Kimi, GPT-4o, …), but the
OpenClaw webchat session for that same group still shows the **defaults**
model (Codex / GPT-4o today).

**Root cause (not ours):** the webchat resolves the session as
`agent:main:telegram:group:<id>` and therefore consults
`agents.defaults.model` instead of looking up the synth agent
(`<assignedAgent>-<groupIdSlug>`) registered by the matching
`bindings[] { type:'route', match.peer.id }` row. The Telegram inbound path
already does the binding lookup, which is why Telegram messages get the
right model and webchat doesn't.

**Channel Manager change needed:** **none.** C1b.2a writes a correct,
schema-legal `agents.list[]` + `bindings[]` pair. Any further change here
would just paper over the upstream resolver bug.

**Planned upstream fix:** open an issue against the OpenClaw repo asking the
webchat session bootstrap to use the same binding lookup as the Telegram
inbound path. Workaround for the operator until then: trust the Telegram
chat as the source of truth for "is the per-channel model live?" and ignore
the webchat model badge for non-default agents.

### 8b.3 · LM Studio context window must be set in the LM Studio app

**Symptom:** even with `models.providers.lmstudio` correctly configured and
`agents.defaults.bootstrapMaxChars` trimmed, an `openclaw infer model run`
against `lmstudio/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b` can fail with
`n_keep: <N> >= n_ctx: <M>`. The OpenClaw side declares `contextWindow:
32768`, but LM Studio loads the model with whatever `n_ctx` was configured
in its UI (often 8k–11k by default).

**Channel Manager change needed:** none. The provider declaration is in
`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and the bootstrap trim is in the same file. The
fix lives in the LM Studio app: load the model with `n_ctx ≥ 16384`
(OpenClaw's catalog minimum); 32768 matches the provider declaration.

**Operator checklist:**

1. LM Studio → Developer → load `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b` with `n_ctx 32768`
   (or 16384 minimum) and "Server Running" on `:1234`.
2. From the agentbox: `curl -s http://100.104.23.43:1234/v1/models` lists
   the model.
3. `openclaw infer model run --model lmstudio/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b
   --prompt "ping"` returns without an `n_ctx` error.
4. `scripts/cm-preflight` automates 2 + 3 plus gateway-active check.

### 8b.2 · React rendering cost during bursts

`[Violation] 'setTimeout' handler took 424 ms` / forced reflows during
SSE bursts are dominated by `ReactMarkdown` rendering large assistant
bubbles synchronously. Addressed structurally in Bundle B / P5 via the
`ChatPanel` split + optional message virtualization. Not on the critical
path for A.

### 8b.4 · CM OpenClaw Chat — gateway-native path (implemented 2026-04-24)

**Goal:** Channel Manager **OpenClaw Chat** should use the **same transport as OpenClaw Control UI**: authenticated **WebSocket (or documented HTTP)** to the local gateway (`gateway.port` / `gateway.auth`), not `openclaw agent …` subprocess spawns per message + JSONL tail for user-visible latency.

**Why:** OC achieves **~2–3 s** perceived round-trip on a warm gateway; CM today pays **CLI spawn + embedded fallback risk + mirror poll** delay (see §8b.1). Native gateway I/O aligns CM with Telegram-adjacent responsiveness.

**Scope (Channel Manager):**

1. Gateway client in Node (reuse protocol from OC / OpenClaw docs): connect with `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, send user turns to the bound Telegram/session peer, subscribe to assistant events.
2. Replace or bypass `sessionSender.js` CLI path for **`POST /api/chat/.../send`** when gateway RPC is available; keep CLI as **fallback** behind a flag if needed for unsupported builds.
3. SSE to the browser: push messages from gateway events (and/or continue tailing JSONL only as backup) so transcript order matches Telegram.
4. Document operator env: token, port, TLS/off-LAN same as OC.

**Implementation slice landed 2026-04-24:**

- `sessionSender.js` is now an orchestrator over two transports:
  `openclawGatewayTransport.js` and `openclawCliTransport.js`.
- Default remains `OPENCLAW_CM_SEND_TRANSPORT=cli` / unset. `auto` attempts
  native gateway only when credentials/module loading are available, then falls
  back before any native RPC is attempted. `gateway` forces native and surfaces
  failures.
- Gateway-native send uses explicit `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` /
  `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` (including values derived from `openclaw.json`) and
  calls gateway `chat.send` with canonical `sessionKey` when known.
- CLI fallback was moved from shell command construction to `spawn` args while
  keeping the existing `/tmp/openclaw-cm-send-*.log` behavior.
- Beta smoke 2026-04-24: one TTG000 send returned
  `transport=session-native-gateway-chat`, `gatewayResultId` populated,
  `gatewayCallMs=76`, `apiTotalMs=79`, and the assistant response landed in the
  canonical session JSONL.

**Completion slice landed 2026-04-24:**

- Live warm-gateway comparison now puts CM perceived latency in the same band
  as OpenClaw Control UI for the tested TTG/model path.
- CM chat header now shows configured model plus live transcript model, with
  provider-normalized comparison (`moonshot/kimi-k2.5` vs `kimi-k2.5`, etc.).
- Per-channel model changes now sync to the correct OpenClaw runtime location:
  `agents.list[].model.primary` for the CM-owned synth agent, not the
  schema-illegal `channels.telegram.groups[*].model`.
- Optimistic user bubbles are replaced when the OpenClaw transcript mirror
  arrives, including timestamp-prefixed user lines and session rebinding.
- `Apply to OpenClaw` now exposes pending changes with a pulsing
  `Press to apply...` state and clears when the operator returns to the last
  clean CM baseline or confirms Apply.

**Residual follow-up (not blocking §8b.4):**

- Keep CLI as the safe production fallback until OpenClaw exposes a stable
  versioned gateway SDK/import surface; current native import discovery still
  needs to tolerate hash-named runtime files.
- Gateway event subscription can later replace JSONL/SSE mirroring, but the
  current transcript mirror is fast enough for the measured UX target.
- Consider flipping default from `cli` to `auto` only after another cold/warm
  smoke pass on the next OpenClaw release.

**Acceptance:**

- Stopwatch: CM chat **user bubble** latency and **assistant** latency are now
  within the same practical band as OC on the same machine (modulo model).
- No regression for session binding / TTG group ids / `resolveCanonicalSession`.
- Roadmap §8b.1 mitigations remain relevant for **fallback** CLI only.

**Dependencies:** Stable gateway RPC surface (versioned) remains desired before
making native/auto the default.

### 8b.5 · TARS in IDE — Cursor/Codex/OpenClaw memory bridge (next)

**Spec:** `SPEC_8B5_IDE_MEMORY_BRIDGE.md`
**Open Brain guardrail:** `SPEC_OPEN_BRAIN_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS.md`

**Current status (2026-04-25):** §8b.5 now has a belastbarer, getesteter
Bridge-Unterbau with clean binding and mapping semantics. Landed slices:
A070 sidecar metadata, `bridgeStatus`, marker-based promote/read-back, UI
status display, backend tests, resolver/adapter safety rail
(`ttgBindingResolver.js`, `ideWorkUnitAdapters.js`), and an operator-managed
`projectMappings[]` store in `channel_config.json`. Mapping writes use lock +
temp-file/rename. Resolver policy is frozen and tested: valid explicit wins,
invalid explicit does not guess, non-explicit conflicts become `ambiguous`.
The UI no longer hardcodes new summaries as Codex with a fixed project root; it
collects adapter/project hints and lets the backend normalize + resolve against
the persisted mapping store. `E2E_GOLDEN_PATH_8B5` is implemented as a
Playwright proof of the current browser operator flow. Artifact-owned TTG
binding is now specified for Discovery/Research work via `initial_ttg` and
`current_ttg` headers; `current_ttg` is the operative routing truth. **Ticket C
`ARTIFACT_HEADER_BINDING_V1` landed 2026-04-25:** backend parses Markdown
frontmatter for `current_ttg` / `initial_ttg`, resolver priority includes
`artifact_header`, sidecar metadata stores header evidence, and the
`POST /api/ide-project-summaries` path is covered by integration tests. Open
Brain integration shifts the architecture to **artifact-centered memory**:
Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Telegram, and Chat are producer surfaces; Studio
Framework artifacts are durable truth; OpenClaw memory is operational agent
continuity; Open Brain is the long-term semantic/MCP knowledge layer.
**Maturity:** project-mapping bridge and promote/read-back core are usable now;
artifact-header Discovery/Research binding is implemented for summary writes;
**operator confirmation** persists a chosen TTG into the artifact YAML via
`POST /api/ide-project-summaries/artifact-binding/confirm` (and `/api/summaries/…`,
same router). Artifact index, classifier fallback, and **read-only Open Brain
export contract** (`GET …/open-brain-export`) are implemented; **CM UI** can
review TTG proposals and **preview** that export payload from the TTG review tab.
**Not done yet:** **live** Open Brain upsert (MCP/API), producer adapters, and
deeper TTG-review polish (full Markdown preview, tighter list filters).
**Ticket G** (stub audit + index merge + CM button) is started; **live OB1**
remains a **later** gate, after **§8b.6** Studio corpus onboarding and header
normalization (see `010_VISION.md` §4).

**Next-session gates:**

1. ✅ **Ticket C — `ARTIFACT_HEADER_BINDING_V1`**: parse Discovery/Research YAML
   headers, map `current_ttg` into the work-unit binding result, and surface
   `binding.method = "artifact_header"` in sidecar/UI.
2. ✅ **Ticket E — `ARTIFACT_INDEX_RESOLVER_V1`**: index Studio artifacts by
   stable id, path, type, tags, TTG binding, project binding, and content hash.
3. ✅ **Ticket F — `OPEN_BRAIN_EXPORT_CONTRACT_V1`**: define the Studio artifact
   export/upsert payload for OB1 `thoughts`, including metadata, source path,
   content hash, no-secrets validation, and dedup identity. Implemented as a
   read-only contract builder; no OB1 sync/write occurs yet.
4. ◐ **Ticket D — `AGENT_TTG_CLASSIFICATION_V1`**: backend classifier and
   artifact-index integration landed. If the human leaves no TTG, the index can
   classify against canonical `TTG*.md` definitions and record
   `inferred` / `needs_review` / `ambiguous` rather than pretending the result
   is confirmed. **Backend confirm path landed 2026-04-26:** `artifact-binding/confirm`
   writes `current_ttg` + confirmed binding into the Markdown header and returns
   a fresh index record. **CM UI slice landed 2026-04-26:** IDE tab
   **Studio artifacts · TTG review** loads the artifact index, lists non-confirmed
   records (sorted with relevance to the active TTG row), and posts confirm with
   optional candidate picks. **Playwright:** `e2e/tests/e2e-golden-path-8b5.spec.js`
   includes **confirms TTG for a Studio artifact via the TTG review tab** (stub
   under `050_Artifacts/…`, then assert index `binding.status === 'confirmed'`).
   **Remaining:** polish (full Markdown preview, stricter scope filters if the list grows noisy); optional E2E for export preview only.
5. ◐ **Ticket G — `ARTIFACT_TO_OPEN_BRAIN_SYNC_V1`**: **slice 2026-04-26**
   `POST /api/ide-project-summaries/open-brain-sync` with `dryRun` (default true)
   and stub provider (`OPEN_BRAIN_SYNC_PROVIDER=stub`, default): writes
   `open_brain_sync_audit.json` next to `channel_config.json`, merges
   `openBrain.syncStatus` / `thoughtId` into `GET …/artifact-index`. **Not done:**
   live OB1/MCP upsert, UI polish beyond CM tab button.
6. **Producer adapters**: Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Telegram/Chat exports create
   or update artifacts; they do not define memory truth.
7. Extend `E2E_GOLDEN_PATH_8B5` with Open Brain **export preview** and (after
   Ticket G live path) **sync** cases.
8. **§8b.6 — Studio corpus onboarding:** ingest external-repo artifacts into
   Studio Framework; mandatory header/structure normalization before treating
   bulk imports as export/sync-ready (vision §4; roadmap §8b.6).

**Recommended order:** Treat **live OB1/MCP upsert** as **downstream** of a
**Studio corpus onboarding** pass (see **§8b.6**): ingest material from other
repos into Studio Framework, then normalize headers/structure; only then prioritize
Ticket G live sync. Until the corpus is ready, **contract + stub audit** in CM
are sufficient preparation. Ticket D polish (preview/filters) and producer
adapters can proceed in parallel where they do not block onboarding.

### 8b.6 · Studio corpus onboarding & header normalization (planned)

**Intent:** Large parts of the knowledge base still live **outside** Studio
Framework (other repositories, legacy trees). Before Open Brain live sync is
worth prioritizing, that material must be **brought into** `Studio_Framework/`
under governed paths and schemas.

**Planned gate — mandatory for ingested artifacts:**

1. **Ingest** — copy or migrate content into the correct Studio tree (e.g.
   `050_Artifacts/…`) with traceability to source repo/commit where applicable.
2. **Header & structure pass** — each imported artifact goes through a defined
   process: YAML front matter (`id`, `type`, `status`, tags, `current_ttg` /
   `initial_ttg`, project fields, timestamps) and body structure aligned to
   Studio rules (e.g. ARYS, `TRACEABILITY_SCHEMA`, discovery templates). This may
   be operator review, scripted lint, batch fixups, or CM/Workbench-assisted
   editing — the exact toolchain is TBD; the **requirement** is that nothing is
   treated as export/sync-ready until the pass is done.
3. **Then** — artifact index + export contract + (later) OB1 upsert operate on a
   **homogeneous** corpus; stub audit and review UIs remain meaningful.

**Dependencies:** Studio-side playbooks or automation for ingestion; may span
`Studio_Framework` repo more than CM. CM continues to **prepare** OB1 (contract,
audit) without requiring OB1 to be fully implemented here first.

**Goal:** Turn the third Channel Manager workspace tab into the operational
bridge between producer work (Cursor/Codex/OpenCode/Chat/Telegram), TTG
context, Studio artifacts, Studio A070 summaries, OpenClaw memory, and Open
Brain.

**Why:** After gateway-native chat works, the next architectural risk is not
graph visualization; it is split-brain context. Work done in the IDE must be
captured, mapped to the correct TTG/project context, and promoted into
OpenClaw memory explicitly enough that TARS can use it without hidden state or
stale assumptions, while keeping Open Brain sync tool-agnostic and
artifact-centered.

**Scope (first slice):**

1. Define the canonical IDE work-unit shape:
   - producer surface (`cursor`, `codex`, `opencode`, `telegram`, `chat`, future tools)
   - project root / repository identity
   - bound TTG/channel id
   - artifact header binding (`initial_ttg`, `current_ttg`) for pre-project
     Discovery/Research work
   - Open Brain export identity (`artifact_id`, `source_path`, `content_hash`)
   - A070 summary path
   - source/provenance metadata (operator, timestamp, model/agent where known)
   - promotion target in OpenClaw memory
2. Harden the existing **TARS in IDE · IDE project summary** tab:
   - create/edit A070 summary drafts
   - save under Studio A070
   - preview existing summaries
   - promote selected summaries to OpenClaw memory
   - read back OpenClaw memory in the same TTG row
3. Map producer context into the same artifact contract:
   `.cursor/agents`, `.cursor/rules`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, exported IDE bundle,
   Codex session notes, OpenCode context, Telegram/Chat exports, and future
   producers must create or update the same artifact metadata instead of
   becoming parallel context systems.
4. Add a per-TTG sync/status signal for this tab:
   - no A070 summary yet
   - draft saved but not promoted
   - promoted to OpenClaw memory
   - read-back confirmed / stale / unknown
5. Keep writes explicit. Saving an A070 summary and promoting into OpenClaw
   memory are separate operator actions; no silent mutation of identity,
   auth, or memory files.

**Acceptance:**

- From a TTG row, the operator can capture current producer work into an A070
  summary or Studio artifact and promote it into OpenClaw memory without leaving
  Channel Manager.
- The OpenClaw memory read-only pane shows the promoted result or a clear
  stale/unknown state.
- The artifact/summary contains enough provenance to map producer work back to
  TTG, project, model/agent where known, source file paths, and Open Brain
  export identity.
- Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Telegram, and Chat are documented as producers of
  the same artifact contract, not separate one-off integrations.
- No regression to the §8b.4 gateway-native chat path.

**Dependencies:** Existing C2 summary/memory promote endpoints, A070 write
support, IDE bundle/export bridge, and the current §8b.4 chat beta.

### 8b.6 · TTG agent topology visualization (after §8b.5)

**Goal:** Add a visual operator surface for one TTG's effective runtime shape:
main agent → assigned model → channel skills → sub-agents → sub-agent skills.

**Why:** Once TTG routing, skill loading, sub-agent skill merging,
gateway-native chat, and IDE/Codex memory promotion are proven, the next useful
UI layer is observability of what a conversation channel is actually composed
of. The current tables remain the editing surface; the topology is a read-only
map for fast inspection and debugging.

**Scope (first slice):**

1. Define a CM topology data shape from existing sources:
   `channel_config.json`, OpenClaw effective tools/skills, canonical session,
   active model, and gateway/runtime metadata where available.
2. Add a read-only **Topology** view per TTG/channel row:
   - selected TTG / conversation channel
   - main agent + active model
   - channel-level skills
   - active sub-agents
   - skills contributed by each sub-agent
3. Keep the first implementation in the current React app. A different
   rendering island (Svelte/Lit/etc.) is allowed later only if the graph
   renderer materially benefits from it; do **not** refactor CM just to match
   another UI stack.
4. Treat this as observability first, not control: no execution buttons or
   runtime mutation until the read-only topology is correct and trusted.

**Acceptance:**

- A selected TTG shows the same effective agent/skill/sub-agent picture that
  the gateway will use at runtime.
- The graph updates after Apply/rebind without requiring a page reload.
- Missing runtime metadata degrades to the configured CM topology with a clear
  "not yet confirmed at runtime" state.
- No regression to the Channel Manager's core table/config workflow.

**Dependencies:** Complete §8b.5 and identify a stable source for
runtime-effective tools/skills (`tools.effective(sessionKey=...)` or
equivalent gateway API).

### 8b.7 · Channel Manager Chat Media V1 (after boundary cleanup + §8b.5)

**Status:** proposed, not next.

**Spec:** [`SPEC_CHANNEL_MANAGER_CHAT_MEDIA_V1.md`](./SPEC_CHANNEL_MANAGER_CHAT_MEDIA_V1.md)

**Goal:** Let the Channel Manager OpenClaw Chat handle one image plus optional
text as one logical chat message, without introducing a Workbench dependency.

**Why:** Operators will need to paste screenshots or visual context into a TTG
conversation. This belongs to the Channel Manager chat surface, not the
Workbench. It should be built after the Channel Manager / Workbench boundary is
clean enough that media upload, preview, and rendering do not become another
cross-feature leak.

**Product rule:** Chat messages should be represented as structured content
parts, not only as a plain text string. V1 supports:

- `text`
- `image`

Existing text-only messages must normalize to:

```ts
parts: [{ type: 'text', text: messageText }]
```

**Scope (V1):**

1. One image per user message.
2. Optional text/caption in the same logical message.
3. Paste from clipboard; optional attach button if low risk.
4. Inline image rendering in the Channel Manager chat history.
5. Lightweight enlarge/preview behavior on click.
6. Mirror/read path normalizes inbound media into the same `parts[]` shape.

**Out of scope for V1:**

- Multi-image messages.
- General file/PDF/video/audio upload.
- Workbench media browser or Workbench file-tree integration.
- A generalized asset library.
- Text-marker hacks where the UI guesses an image from raw transcript text.

**Architecture rules:**

- This is a **Channel Manager chat** feature.
- No imports from Workbench pages or Workbench stores.
- Media normalization belongs in the chat message model / backend adapter
  layer; React bubbles render structured `parts[]`.
- Backend must validate MIME type and size before accepting or forwarding
  media.
- Allowed V1 MIME types: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`; `image/gif`
  only if explicitly enabled. No SVG in V1.

**Likely implementation order:**

1. Introduce message-part normalization for existing text messages.
2. Add composer attachment state and image preview.
3. Add image bubble renderer.
4. Add backend media send endpoint or gateway-native media forwarding once the
   gateway path is confirmed.
5. Extend mirror/read normalization for media events.
6. Add browser QA: paste image + optional text, send, render, mirror.

**Acceptance:**

- User can paste one image into the Channel Manager chat composer.
- User can send image-only or image + text as one logical message.
- Existing text messages behave unchanged.
- Chat history displays image and text together.
- Mirror/read path renders image messages from structured data.
- No Workbench dependency is introduced.
- Build/test/E2E remain green.

### 8b.8 · Workbench / Channel Manager Boundary Hardening (later)

**Status:** follow-up, not blocking current §8b.5 work.

**Cleanup baseline:** [`SESSION_CLEANUP_2026-04-25.md`](./SESSION_CLEANUP_2026-04-25.md)

**Workbench product boundary:** [`SPEC_WORKBENCH_POSITIONING.md`](./SPEC_WORKBENCH_POSITIONING.md)

**Closed already:**

- Workbench state moved out of the Workbench page.
- Channel Manager no longer imports from the Workbench page.
- Channel Manager and Workbench pages moved under feature folders.
- Feature public entrypoints exist.
- Global theme CSS moved to `frontend/src/shared/styles/theme.css`.

**Remaining hardening:**

1. Move feature-owned Channel Manager components/hooks/utils under
   `frontend/src/features/channel-manager/`.
2. Move feature-owned Workbench components/hooks/utils under
   `frontend/src/features/workbench/` as they appear.
3. Move generic frontend utilities into `frontend/src/shared/`.
4. Later, move backend routes/services into feature folders:
   `backend/src/features/channel-manager/` and `backend/src/features/workbench/`.
5. Add import-boundary checks or a lightweight review checklist.

**Style rule:** Keep theme tokens and global styling shared. Do not fork CSS per
feature. Future dark/light mode and style alignment should build on the shared
theme layer, not on duplicate Channel Manager / Workbench stylesheets.

**Product rule:** The Workbench is a lean artifact/worktree editor with
diff-first workflows. It is not a full IDE replacement and must not own TTG,
memory promotion, OpenClaw Apply, Open Brain sync, or Channel Manager chat
media behavior.

**Acceptance:**

- No feature page imports implementation details from another feature page.
- Shared styles remain a single source of truth.
- Feature-owned UI/code sits in the owning feature folder.
- Shared utilities are intentionally shared, not a dumping ground.
- Build and E2E remain green after each slice.

### 8b.9 · Slash-Command Parity And Send-Path Correctness (later)

**Status:** proposed, not next.
**Priority:** medium.
**Depends on:** §8b.4 gateway-native chat path stabilization.

**Problem:** Channel Manager Chat does not yet have clean parity with native
OpenClaw Chat for slash inputs. Normal text messages are sent through the
OpenClaw path and mirrored, but slash inputs such as `/new` can appear locally
in Channel Manager without arriving in the native OpenClaw chat or executing as
real commands. That creates a dangerous pseudo-send state: the UI can suggest
that something was sent even when the true command/send path did not happen.

**Goal:** Slash inputs must either dispatch through an explicit command path or
fail visibly. They must not create normal optimistic user bubbles unless a real
dispatch is confirmed.

**V1 scope:**

1. Detect leading `/` inputs in the composer as command candidates.
2. Separate normal text sends from command requests, either by request type or
   endpoint.
3. Suppress normal optimistic user bubbles for unconfirmed commands.
4. Show pending/success/failure command states explicitly.
5. Check core cases: `/new`, `/reset`, `/status`, `/commands`, `/reasoning`,
   `/model`, `/approve`, `/focus`, `/unfocus`, `/session`.

**Out of scope:**

- Custom slash commands.
- Full command palette / autocomplete v2.
- Command ACL management UI.

**Acceptance:**

- `/new` no longer appears as a local-only sent message.
- Unsupported or undispatchable commands fail visibly.
- `/status` and `/commands` produce either native results or clear fallback
  errors.
- Successful command effects are reflected in session/mirror behavior.
- E2E covers at least one successful command and one failed command.

---

## 9. Release cadence

- **Phase 0** — landed.
- **Bundle A** — landed as three commits (P1, P2, P3) in that order.
- **Bundle B** — closed 2026-04-18 (P5 + P4). `/api/telegram/*` and
  `/api/openclaw/*` remain as **one-release** thin aliases; remove in the
  following PR after clients migrate.
- **Bundle C1** — apply MVP landed 2026-04-18 (`requireMention` merge + UI).
- **Bundle C1b** — slice closed (§5.1, 2026-04-20): **C1b.1** … **C1b.3** as above; **C1b.2c** workspace-default model opt-in shipped. Further C1b work only if re-scoped. See §5.1.
- **Bundle C2** — landed 2026-04-18 (summary → memory promote + modal).
- **Local LLM (LM Studio) wiring** — landed 2026-04-18: `lmstudio` provider registered, plugin enabled, all CM channels and `agents.list[]` re-pointed to `lmstudio/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b`. Open dependency: LM Studio `n_ctx ≥ 16384` (operator action, see §8b.3). Webchat-vs-binding parity is upstream (§8b.2a, ADR-018).

Each PR updates `030_ROADMAP.md` (moves its block to "done") and appends a new
entry to `040_DECISIONS.md` only if it contains an irrevocable architectural
choice.
