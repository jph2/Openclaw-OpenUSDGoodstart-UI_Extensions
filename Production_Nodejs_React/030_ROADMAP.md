## 2. Phase 0 — Documentation consolidation (done today)

**Outcome:** 14 patched/dated documents distilled into 4 normative docs:

- `010_VISION.md` — purpose, principles, non-goals
- `020_ARCHITECTURE.md` — the current system
- `030_ROADMAP.md` — this file
- `040_DECISIONS.md` — ADR log

Source documents moved to `_archive/2026-04/` with a breadcrumb pointer
(`_archive/2026-04/README.md`). The archive is **reference-only**; new
information lands in the four normative docs.

---

## 3. Bundle A — Performance and cleanup (done)

**Goal:** unbreak CPU and perceived latency, remove dead code and stale
fallbacks. No architectural changes. Landed as three commits in order P1 → P2 → P3.

### A / P1 — Fan kill (done)

- ✅ Replaced the 2-second sessions-directory polling in `telegramService.js`
  with two scoped `chokidar.watch()` instances: one on `sessions.json`
  (debounced 200 ms), one whose path set tracks the canonical `sessionFile`
  of each group currently present in `sessions.json`.
- ✅ Removed the internal rate-limit trampoline inside
  `hydrateOpenclawSessionIndex` and the per-call hydrate inside
  `resolveCanonicalSession` / `refreshChatMirrorFromCanonicalSession`.

### A / P2 — Perceived latency (done)

- ✅ `TelegramChat.jsx` switched to `behavior: 'auto'`, keyed the auto-scroll
  effect on `filteredMessages.length`, and added a `stuckToBottomRef` gate so
  auto-scroll only runs when the user is within 80 px of the bottom.
- ✅ SSE state updates (`INIT`, `SESSION_REBOUND`, `MESSAGE`) are wrapped in
  `startTransition()` so typing, button clicks and scroll stay responsive
  during bursts.

### A / P2b — Scroll-settle follow-up (done)

Field test of P2 showed the auto-scroll gate was too pessimistic on long
backlogs: `scrollTo({top: el.scrollHeight})` ran before ReactMarkdown /
fenced code blocks finished expanding, so the target was stale and the
new message landed just below the viewport.

- ✅ Added a zero-height bottom sentinel at the end of the messages
  list and switched to `sentinel.scrollIntoView({block:'end'})` inside
  a `requestAnimationFrame`, so the scroll target reflects the final
  post-paint layout.
- ✅ Added a `ResizeObserver` on the messages container that re-asserts
  the scroll pin whenever the container's size grows while the user is
  still anchored (catches the late expansion of markdown code blocks).
- ✅ Added `suppressNextScrollFlipRef` so the `onScroll` event fired as
  a side effect of our own `scrollIntoView` can't race layout and flip
  `stuckToBottomRef` to false.

### A / P3 — Dead code purge (done)

- ✅ Deleted `historyScanner.mjs`, `ActiveBotsList.jsx` and the
  `/api/telegram/bots/:chatId` route + `getChatBots`.
- ✅ Removed the `Telegraf` import, the `bot` / `relayBot` / `mainBotInfo` /
  `relayBotInfo` globals, the `scanHistory` hydration block, and the
  disabled `bot.launch()` scaffolding from `telegramService.js`.
- ✅ Removed the hardcoded `-3736210177 → -1003752539559` alias fix-up from
  both `CHAT_ID_ALIASES` and `routes/telegram.js`.
- ✅ Removed the `process.cwd()`-relative Prototyp fallback in
  `hydrateChannelAliasesFromDiskSync`; the function now requires
  `WORKSPACE_ROOT` and logs a single warning if it is missing.
- ✅ Removed `sendViaHttpGateway` and its call site in `sendMessageToChat`.
  The HTTP fast path was never reachable in practice; `sendMessageToChat`
  now goes straight to the `openclaw` CLI. It will be re-introduced only
  when the gateway exposes a functional
  `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/send`.

**Acceptance (observed):**

- CPU on an idle chat panel is effectively zero; fan no longer ramps.
- First paint of an open chat is well under 300 ms on a warm backend.
- `grep` for `historyScanner`, `Telegraf`, `sendViaHttpGateway`,
  `getChatBots`, `ActiveBotsList`, or the hardcoded group-id fallback
  returns no hits outside `_archive/` and standalone `backend/test-*.js`
  scripts.

### A / P4 — Tool call / tool result accordion (done)

Feedback on the live chat: `⚙️ [Tool Call: exec]` markers and raw
`System (Tool) BOT` output bubbles made the transcript hard to scan.
OpenClaw's own UI keeps those collapsed by default and reveals the
payload on click.

- ✅ Backend: `buildMsgObjFromGatewayLine` no longer flattens toolCall /
  toolResult into text markers. Instead it attaches two structured
  arrays to the message: `toolCalls: [{id, name, input}]` and
  `toolResults: [{id, toolUseId, toolName, output, isError}]`. The
  `output` field flattens nested `content` blocks (string or
  `[{type:"text", text}]`).
- ✅ Frontend: new `ToolCallChip` renders under an assistant bubble
  ("⚙ exec" chevron chip; click expands the JSON `input`). New
  `ToolResultBubble` replaces the entire `senderRole === 'toolResult'`
  bubble with a single-line preview ("Tool output · exec · <first 72
  chars>") that expands into a scrollable `<pre>` on click. Error
  results use a red accent.
- ✅ `stripToolCallMarkers` removes the residual
  `⚙️ [Tool Call: …]` / `✅ [Tool Result: …]` text so we don't render the
  same information twice during the transition period.
- ✅ `filteredMessages` keeps bubbles that have no plain text but do
  carry structured tool data, so a pure tool-call or tool-result
  message is never silently dropped.

## 4. Bundle B — Refactor (after A)

**Goal:** split the god objects so Bundle C can be built on clean seams.
Keep external API stable; mount aliases for one release.

### B / P5 — Service split

Split `telegramService.js` into focused modules under `backend/services/chat/`:

- `sessionIndex.js` — `sessions.json` watcher + group/session mapping.
- `sessionTail.js` — chokidar tail of one canonical JSONL.
- `messageModel.js` — `buildMsgObjFromGatewayLine` and UI-shape helpers.
- `sessionSender.js` — `openclaw` CLI wrapper (and, later, native session send).
- `channelAliases.js` — channel alias resolution from `channel_config.json`.

Frontend: extract `useChatSession(groupId)` hook; rename `TelegramChat.jsx`
to `ChatPanel.jsx` (render-only).

### B / P4 — Route consolidation

Merge `routes/telegram.js` and `routes/openclaw.js` into `routes/chat.js`
exposing `/api/chat/:groupId/{session,stream,send}`. Delete the dynamic
`await import` workaround in `routes/openclaw.js`. Keep `/api/telegram/*`
and `/api/openclaw/session/*/send` mounted as thin aliases for **one**
release, then remove.

**Acceptance:**

- No single service file > ~250 lines.
- No dynamic imports in route files.
- Old paths still respond; new paths documented in `020_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 5. Bundle C1 — Config apply (after B)

**Goal:** let the operator promote `channel_config.json` state into the
OpenClaw Gateway's `openclaw.json`, safely.

### Backend

- `POST /api/exports/openclaw/apply` with:
  - `dryRun: true` as default.
  - JSON-schema check of the projected object.
  - File lock on `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
  - Timestamped backup (`openclaw.json.<ts>.bak`).
  - Atomic write (temp file + `rename`).
  - Audit entry (who, when, diff hash).
  - One-click undo: restore from the last `.bak`.

### Frontend

- **Apply** button on the Configuration tab.
- Modal with a readable diff between disk and projection, schema errors, and
  destination path.
- "Undo last apply" button while a recent `.bak` is present.

**Acceptance:**

- No apply can happen without explicit Confirm in the dialog.
- Backups accumulate to a bounded number (rotate after N).
- Schema failure blocks write.

---

## 6. Bundle C2 — Summary → memory promotion (after C1)

**Goal:** let the operator explicitly carry an IDE/Cursor summary into
OpenClaw's memory space.

### Backend

- `POST /api/summaries/promote` writing into
  `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:
  - Append semantics, not replace.
  - De-duplication (skip if the exact block already exists).
  - `MEMORY.md` **only** as an explicit destination opt-in.
  - Audit entry.

### Frontend

- **Promote to OpenClaw memory** button on each summary entry in the Cursor
  Summary tab.
- Modal:
  - Destination selector (default: today's daily file).
  - Full preview of the text to be written.
  - Dedup warning when the block already exists in the destination.
  - Confirm / Cancel.

**Default mode:** manual-with-preview (see `040_DECISIONS.md` §ADR-014).

**Acceptance:**

- Nothing lands in `memory/` without an explicit click.
- `MEMORY.md` requires an additional opt-in from the destination selector.

## 7. Backlog (kept, not scheduled)

These items were on the previous plan's task list and remain valid but are
not part of the A → B → C1 → C2 sequence above.

| Id     | Item                                                                                   |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6.3   | Memory history hydration (Rosetta scanner for `memory/*.md`).                           |
| 6.4   | TARS Hub deep-link integration (`:18789/chat?session=…`) from channel cards.            |
| 6.5   | Atomic config persistence hardening (chokidar signal on `POST /api/channels/config`).   |
| 6.6   | Session visibility: show `sessionKey` / parity indicator in the UI.                     |
| 6.9   | Native chat media (images/files) — requires gateway support.                            |
| 6.10b | Write new A070 summary markdown from the UI (today: read-only).                         |
| 6.11  | Skills tab filter/sort/search/custom order.                                             |
| 6.17  | Mark `toolResult` lines so they are not rendered as plain user-facing chat history.     |
| 6.18  | Session-native send binding (evidence `API_DIRECT_TEST_1814`).                          |
| 8.3   | MCP Sovereign Bridge verification after IDE reload.                                     |
| 9.*   | MCP whitelisting: `allowedMCPs` schema, UI, policy injection.                           |
| 10.1  | Replacement for `occ-ctl.mjs` (Makefile or root `package.json`).                        |
| 11.1  | Absolute-path audit across `.js`/`.mjs`/`.sh`/`.json`.                                  |
| 11.3  | ARYS/GILD metadata sync (`git_path` mass update).                                       |

## 8. Future (out of scope for this cycle)

- **Triad weighting in the channel UI** (three sliders summing to 100 %);
  depends on Harness/OpenClaw semantics and schema work.
- **Main-agent dynamic spawn flag** (a main agent allowed to spawn additional
  sub-agents at runtime); depends on OpenClaw runtime contract.
- **Multi-user or remote operator UIs.**
- **Engine-per-message picker** — explicitly rejected in `040_DECISIONS.md`
  §ADR-007; do not re-raise without a new decision record.

---

## 9. Release cadence

- **Phase 0** — landed.
- **Bundle A** — landed as three commits (P1, P2, P3) in that order.
- **Bundle B** — one PR; `/api/telegram/*` aliases kept for **one release**,
  then removed in the following PR.
- **Bundle C1, C2** — one PR each, blocked on B.

Each PR updates `030_ROADMAP.md` (moves its block to "done") and appends a new
entry to `040_DECISIONS.md` only if it contains an irrevocable architectural
choice.
