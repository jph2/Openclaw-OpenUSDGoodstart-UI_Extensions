## 2. Snapshot

| Area | State |
| ---- | ----- |
| Configuration tab | Functional; TTG CRUD, sub-agent CRUD, skills list, row heights persist. |
| OpenClaw Chat mirror | Functional; auto-scroll v3, tool chips collapsed, optimistic user bubble, gateway-native transport slice shipped with CLI fallback. Next active backlog pull-forward: structured chat media attachments. |
| Cursor / IDE summaries tab | Live; A070 summary list/renderer, summary drafts, memory promote modal, project mapping, artifact index/review, Open Brain export/stub sync. |
| IDE chat capture | **Partially shipped (6.22):** backend capture endpoints + Summaries UI. Linux flow is **Step 0 terminal mount** + **required Step 1 Save path**. Old in-UI SMB wizard removed. Remaining: nightly summary-delta job, retention, other producers. |
| IDE Bridge (MCP) | Live for `send_telegram_reply` and `change_agent_mode`. |
| Exports | Live: `/api/exports/{canonical,openclaw,ide,cursor}`; IDE export apply + stale-check v2 (managed blocks, orphan detection). Repo-Export ~88–93%; next: prune-managed, skill/MCP verification toward 90–95%. |
| Config Apply to `openclaw.json` | C1/C1b shipped: group policy, synth agents/bindings, skills merge, orphan prune, account policy, defaults model opt-in, stale-session release script. Next: runtime verification/readback. |
| Summary promotion to memory | Live (C2): explicit `POST /api/summaries/promote` / `POST /api/ide-project-summaries/promote`; no silent memory writes. |
| Local LLM / LM Studio | Wired; operator must still load model in LM Studio with sufficient `n_ctx` (`>= 16384`, 32768 recommended). |
| Studio ARYS header governance (§8b.6C) | **V1 read-only scan** lives in sibling repo `Studio_Framework/tools/arys_header_governance/`; normative spec [`SPEC_8B6C_STUDIO_ARYS_HEADER_GOVERNANCE_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_8B6C_STUDIO_ARYS_HEADER_GOVERNANCE_V1.md). |
| **Domain → artifact & TTG mapping (§8b.6D)** | **Critical / next for import ordering.** Versioned mapper + `ROUTER_IDENTITY_DOMAIN.md` as narrative seed; spec [`SPEC_8B6D_DOMAIN_TTG_ARTIFACT_MAPPING_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_8B6D_DOMAIN_TTG_ARTIFACT_MAPPING_V1.md). Template: `Studio_Framework/095_Migration_Staging/General_Dev/<batch-id>/mapping/domain_to_artifact_ttg.v1.yaml`. |
| **Governance stack** (CM vs OpenClaw workspace vs IDE) | [`SPEC_GOVERNANCE_STACK_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_GOVERNANCE_STACK_V1.md): CM = control plane / Apply–export; **`~/.openclaw/workspace/`** = soul, `GOVERNANCE.md`, skills; Studio = **one** `.cursor/rules/openclaw-workspace-authority.mdc` pointer (no extra normative `.mdc` shards). |
| OpenClaw webchat ↔ Telegram binding parity | Known upstream limitation (ADR-018): webchat session resolver still reads defaults for some group sessions. |

## 4. Active / Next Blocks

| Block | Status | Next useful action |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------ |
| §8b.5 — IDE Memory Bridge | Summary → TTG scoring/review is implemented; current hardening loop is candidate-shape normalization and promote allowlist tightening. See [`SPEC_8B5_IDE_MEMORY_BRIDGE.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_8B5_IDE_MEMORY_BRIDGE.md). | Harden `agent_classification` review surfaces: normalize string/object candidates everywhere, make promote eligibility an explicit allowlist, and preserve classifier distributions as review evidence only. |
| §8b.8 / 6.9 — Channel Manager chat media attachments | V1 image send/mirror/render path is implemented; current hardening loop is media preview correctness and file-serving safety. See [`SPEC_CHANNEL_MANAGER_CHAT_MEDIA_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_CHANNEL_MANAGER_CHAT_MEDIA_V1.md). | Harden V1 image path: fix optimistic `data:` previews, validate MIME/size before browser reads, serve mirrored media with symlink/scope protections, and render only `image/*` media as image parts. |
| C1c / §8b.7A — Dual-target Agent/Skill configuration | Active; OpenClaw **Apply** ~92–96%, **Runtime** ~55–70%; Cursor **Repo-Export** ~88–93%, **IDE-Parität** ~40–55%. See [`SPEC_CM_DUAL_TARGET_AGENT_SKILL_CONFIG_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_CM_DUAL_TARGET_AGENT_SKILL_CONFIG_V1.md). | Close Cursor export gap (~90–95%): `--prune-managed`, skill existence checks, MCP bridge verification. OpenClaw: configured-vs-runtime topology/readback, stale-session guidance. |
| 6.22 — IDE chat capture pipeline | Partially shipped; see [`030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/ide-chat-capture-a070.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/ide-chat-capture-a070.md). | After path/mount UX stabilization, implement nightly summary-delta job and retention policy. |
| §8b.6 — General_Dev -> Studio corpus migration | Active planning; `General_Dev` is the legacy source corpus and must be frozen, inventoried, staged through quality/security gates, header-normalized, and then imported into Studio Framework. See [`SPEC_GENERAL_DEV_STUDIO_MIGRATION_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_GENERAL_DEV_STUDIO_MIGRATION_V1.md). | First freeze `General_Dev` with a commit+push, then create a read-only inventory and a `095_Migration_Staging/General_Dev/<batch-id>/` quarantine layer before any final import. |
| **§8b.6D — Domain → Studio artifact & TTG mapping** | **Critical priority — next implementation wave for orderly import.** Turn `ROUTER_IDENTITY_DOMAIN.md` + `Domain_*` / `General_*` inventory into a **versioned YAML mapping** (`source_prefix` → `studio_target`, optional **TTG candidates** as hypotheses, confidence/reviewer, explicit `deferred`). **Not** Open Brain; **not** auto-`confirmed` TTG from folder names. See [`SPEC_8B6D_DOMAIN_TTG_ARTIFACT_MAPPING_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_8B6D_DOMAIN_TTG_ARTIFACT_MAPPING_V1.md). Prior art: archived lesson `gendev-lesson-domain-ttg-mapper`. Template in Studio batch: `mapping/domain_to_artifact_ttg.v1.yaml`. | Populate rows from manifest top-level prefixes + router §4; validate coverage; wire import tooling to `accepted` rows only; surface ambiguous rows for CM/operator review. |
| **§8b.6C — Studio ARYS header governance** | **High priority / next slice.** Replace legacy General_Dev Python header stack with **Studio-native**, read-first tooling: structural scans, duplicate `id` reports, mechanical vs semantic review split; optional later apply with dry-run. **V1 shipped:** `Studio_Framework/tools/arys_header_governance/scan-markdown-headers.mjs`. See [`SPEC_8B6C_STUDIO_ARYS_HEADER_GOVERNANCE_V1.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_8B6C_STUDIO_ARYS_HEADER_GOVERNANCE_V1.md). Prior art: archived lesson `gendev-lesson-header-normalization`; legacy `General_Dev/Master_Rules/040_Framework_TOOLS/arys_header_normalize_v12.py` (+ validators). | Run default scan on `050_Artifacts/` before releases or in CI; extend with per-type rules, manifest `header: fixed/review`, and CM artifact index hooks. |
| §8b.7 — TTG topology readout | Planned after §8b.5 is stable. | Define read-only effective topology shape (agent, model, channel skills, sub-agents, runtime confirmation). |

## 5. Backlog And Later Work

The backlog table and release cadence live in
[`030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/backlog-future-release.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/backlog-future-release.md).

High-signal later items:

- **(Optional)** Workbench **corpus search** + **tag vocabulary lint** (same backlog **6.23**) — not Open Brain; prior art in `General_Dev`: `Master_Rules/.cursor/skills/framework-rag/scripts/framework_rag.py`; `Master_Rules/master_tag_system.yml`; `Master_Rules/TAG_SEMANTIC_INDEX.md`. See [`backlog-future-release.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/backlog-future-release.md).
- Channel Manager chat media V1 is now active as §8b.8 / 6.9 above.
- Workbench / Channel Manager boundary hardening: [`SPEC_WORKBENCH_POSITIONING.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SPEC_WORKBENCH_POSITIONING.md) and [`SESSION_CLEANUP_2026-04-25.md`](./030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/SESSION_CLEANUP_2026-04-25.md).
- Slash-command parity and no-fake-send guardrails in CM chat (§8b.10).
- MCP whitelisting and Sovereign Bridge verification (after C1c / Cursor bundle v2 contracts stabilize).
- Replacement for the missing `occ-ctl.mjs` entrypoint.

## 6. Current IDE Capture Operator Truth

This is repeated here because it caused the most recent confusion:

1. **Step 0** makes `workspaceStorage` readable by the backend host
   (manual CIFS mount, local tree, WSL path, or other mount).
2. **Step 1 Save path is required** for normal setups. It persists the exact
   `workspaceStorage` path to `ide_capture_settings.json`; otherwise the backend
   does not know which path to scan. The normal exception is a server-side
   `CURSOR_WORKSPACE_STORAGE_ROOT` env override.
3. **Step 2 `mkdir -p` is optional** and only creates missing directories; it
   never copies chats and is unnecessary if Step 0 already created/mounted the
   tree.

If diagnostics say **reachable on API host**, the mount/path problem is solved;
debug remaining capture issues as extraction, permissions, last-run errors, or
downstream summary work.

**Git (this repo, `main`):** `874f51d` — CLI-first capture flow, `030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/`
split, UI/docs alignment; `9b56316` — ignore `**/ide_capture_settings.json` at repo
root so operator paths stay local. **Studio_Framework** (runbook + A070 `capture/`
hygiene): `c6dce69`, `547c9e1`.

## 7. Maintenance Rule

Each PR or work session updates:

1. `030_ROADMAP.md` for status rows and routing.
2. The owning detail file under `030_ROADMAP_DETAILS/` for full context.
3. `040_DECISIONS.md` only for durable architecture decisions.

Avoid appending long handover prose directly to this file.
